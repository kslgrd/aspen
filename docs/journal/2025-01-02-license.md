I want Aspen to be open source, but after seeing how that worked for Elasticsearch, Redis, WordPress, and a bunch of other software recently I feel skittish.

I want anyone to be able to use this software, I just don't want anyone to be able to profit from it. It seems inevitable that anything valuable will eventually be exploited for profit.

I did a bit of research on how to avoid that and found the [Commons Clause](https://commonsclause.com/), which seems like a decent compromise. I can still allow all the use cases that I care about, but no one can swoop in and profit off this project. The downside is that Aspen won't actually be open sourceâ€”instead it's source-available. Blame Capitalism.

So far as the actual license, I skimmed the MIT, BSD, and Apache 2 licenses, and chose Apache 2. I liked that it was more protective of patent grants and trademarks.
