# Data

I want to consolidate all the things I do at work. I can't ever find anything when I'm looking for it. My work is spread across this gross mess of to-dos, notes, items in Jira or Azure DevOps, wikis, channels in Teams, random documents, meetings, emails, and endless group chats.

I want it to be really easy to create new data types and arbitrarily link them together. This is what graph databases are made to do, but choosing a graph database is a challenge.

Things I'm considering when researching graph DBs:

- Aspen will be free to use, so the DB can't cost money
- Aspen will run locally, so I don't care about cloud hosting
- My vision is that Aspen will be decentralized (ðŸ¤ž), so performance and scalability aren't high priorities
- To be local-first, I'll need to embed the DB within the app (which might be impossible for the web...) so I need to make sure licenses don't prevent that

I spent a bunch of time looking at different graph DBs:

- **Neo4j**
  - I like the looks of the Cypher query language, but there's a learning curve there
  - Inscrutable licensing is off-putting
  - Pretty sure all the auth stuff is locked up in the enterprise edition
  - Really easy to get running locally
- **Memgraph**
  - Also uses Cypher
  - Claims to be more performant, which isn't a big deal for me
  - All the auth stuff is locked up in the enterprise edition
  - Licensing seems unfriendly
- **Arango DB**
  - Licensing looks like a non-starter
- **JanusGraph**
  - Key pitch is "very large graphs"... 
  - Great license
  - I'm not sure I like the look of the Gremlin query language...
- **Postgres with Apache AGE**
  - Kind of annoying to get working
  - Feels like a kludge
  - Gives me an RDBMS if I decide I want one down the line...
- **Dgraph**
  - Integration with GraphQL looks rad for rapid prototyping
  - DQL looks really easy to drop into
  - Ooooh, custom resolvers are written in Typescript
  - OH! [Enterprise-only features are going open-source in 2025](https://hypermode.com/blog/the-future-of-dgraph-is-open-serverless-and-ai-ready)!
  - I'm going to play around with this...
